1. Introduction
---------------

Welcome to Equalizer, the standard middleware to create and deploy parallel,
scalable OpenGL applications. This release introduces major new features,
most notably asynchronous readbacks, region of interest and thread affinity
for increased performance during scalable rendering.

Equalizer 1.4.1 is a bugfix release for Equalizer 1.4, containing the fixes
`listed below`_.

Equalizer 1.4 is a feature release extending the 1.0 API, distilling over
seven years of development and decades of experience into a feature-rich,
high-performance and mature parallel rendering framework and an object-
oriented high-level network library. It is intended for all application
developers creating parallel, interactive OpenGL applications. Equalizer 1.4
can be retrieved by downloading the `source code`_ or one of the `precompiled
packages`_.


1.1. Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Equalizer provides the following major features to facilitate the development
and deployment of scalable OpenGL applications. A `detailed feature list`_
can be found on the Equalizer website.

-   **Runtime Configurability:** An Equalizer application is configured
    automatically or manually at runtime and can be deployed on laptops,
    multi-GPU workstations and large-scale visualization clusters without
    recompilation.
-   **Runtime Scalability:** An Equalizer application can benefit from
    multiple graphics cards, processors and computers to scale rendering
    performance, visual quality and display size.
-   **Distributed Execution:** Equalizer applications can be written to
    support cluster-based execution. Equalizer furnishes and uses the Collage
    network library, a cross-platform C++ library for building heterogenous,
    distributed applications.
-   **Support for Stereo and Immersive Environments:** Equalizer supports
    stereo rendering head tracking, head-mounted displays and other advanced
    features for immersive Virtual Reality installations.

3. About
--------

Equalizer is a cross-platform toolkit, designed to run on any modern
operating system, including all Unix variants and the Windows operating
system. A `compatibility matrix`_ can be found on the Equalizer website.

Equalizer requires at least `OpenGL 1.1`_, but uses newer OpenGL features
when available. Version 1.4 has been tested on:


3.1. Operating System Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Equalizer uses CMake to create a platform-specific build environment. The
following platforms and build environments are tested:

-   **Linux:** Ubuntu 11.10, 12.04, RHEL 6.1 (Makefile, i386, x64)
-   **Windows:** 7 (Visual Studio 2008, i386, x64)
-   **Mac OS X:** 10.7 (Makefile, XCode, i386, x64)


3.2. Window System Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   **X11:** Full support for all documented features
-   **WGL:** Full support for all documented features
-   **AGL:** Full support for all documented features


3.3. Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Programming and User Guide is available as a `hard-copy`_ and `online`_.
The `API documentation`_ can be found on the Equalizer website.

As with any open source project, the available source code, in particular the
shipped `examples`_ provide a reference for developing or porting
applications. The `Developer Documentation`_ on the website provides further
design documents for specific features.


3.4. Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Technical questions can be posted to the ` Developer Mailing List`_, or
directly to ` info@equalizergraphics.com`_.

Commercial support, custom software development and porting services are
available from `Eyescale`_. Please contact `info@eyescale.ch`_ for further
information.
